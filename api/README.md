# xgpu API and WebGPU specification input

This directory contains the canonical API declaration and vendored WebGPU IDL
used by every xgpu runtime adapter. The API is exported under the **`gpu`**
namespace; `wgpu` is its Rust backend.

`webgpu.idl` was copied from hlwgpu's specification snapshot, recorded there
as fetched on 2026-09-07 from
<https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/webgpu.idl>. It is checked in so builds use
a fixed input and do not fetch the specification over the network.

`canvas.idl` holds the HTML standard's `OffscreenCanvas`, verbatim from
W3C's webref at the revision its header names. The web backend's wire
carries it beside WebGPU, so the agent can set the size of the canvas it owns.

## How generators use it

[`../gpu.api.rs`](../gpu.api.rs) selects the WebIDL declarations to expose:

```rust
#[idl("GPUBlendFactor")]
enum BlendFactor {}

#[idl("GPUBufferUsage")]
mod BufferUsage {}

#[idl("GPUSupportedLimits")]
enum Limit {}
```

The `xgpu-bindgen` build dependency reads these declarations and generates:

- Caribou enum schemas and Rust enum types, such as `gpu.BlendFactor`.
- Finite catalogs from readonly interface attributes, such as every member of
  `GPUSupportedLimits`.
- Static constant accessors, such as `gpu.BufferUsage.STORAGE()`.
- Typed resource and descriptor wrappers and the `plugin!` export table from
  the declarations in `gpu.api.rs`.

Haxe discovers the resulting types through `-lib caribou`. The same plugin
metadata is available to other Caribou frontends. There is no separate
HashLink primitive table or generated `wgpu` Haxe package.

## Scope

The IDL is a source for enum values and constants, and a reference for future
API coverage. Its presence does **not** mean the plugin implements every
WebGPU operation or descriptor. Resource methods are explicitly declared in
`gpu.api.rs` and implemented in [`../src/backend.rs`](../src/backend.rs).
Texture and vertex formats are generated from their complete IDL catalogs.
The backend rejects the one draft vertex format that has no wgpu 30
equivalent; feature-gated texture formats remain conditional on the adapter.

The previous hlwgpu coverage figures do not describe this plugin. See the
[GPU plugin README](../README.md) for the supported operations, Caribou types,
resource lifetime rules and runnable compute example.

## Updating the snapshot

Replace `webgpu.idl` deliberately and record its source date or revision here.
Review changes to the selected enum ordering against the backend mappings,
update the API declaration and native implementations together, then run the
binding-generator and GPU-plugin tests. The build reads this file; it never
rewrites it.
